# TradishionalGR-Website
SOS: Vanilla JavaScript used. Only some jQuery to render items.


The following website is a part of my first website, where I used vanilla JavaScript in order to make a website where:
- There are some products
- These products are splitted into 3 categories: Other, Cheese, Spirits
- For these products there's a filtering option that displays only the selected category.
- There is also a product description when you press the details button.
- Clicking an add to cart button increments the value of the span in this small basket and the product is then added to the basket.
- When the products are added to the basket, their individual costs are incremented if you put more than one in the basket and then everything is added together to give you the total cost.
- There's also a login method as you can see on the top right corner.



TODO:
- Make some buttons look more appealing.
- Comments in my code.
